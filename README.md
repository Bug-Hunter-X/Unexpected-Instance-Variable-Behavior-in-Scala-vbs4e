This example demonstrates a common misunderstanding in Scala regarding instance variables declared with `var`.  Each instance of a class receives its own independent copy of instance variables, even if the value is modified within a method.  This behavior might be counter-intuitive for programmers familiar with languages where class-level variables are shared between instances. The solution illustrates how to manage this behavior correctly by using immutable data structures or by making the counter a member of a companion object to ensure a single counter is shared among all instances.
